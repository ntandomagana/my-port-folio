            Hey there! I'm Ntando, a frontend developer turned full-stack
            enthusiast. My passion for building smooth, user-friendly
            applications started with a simple curiosity about how websites
            work. I'm currently sharpening my backend skills with Java Spring
            Boot while working on full-stack projects. My stack includes
            Angular, React, Tailwind CSS, and Node.js, and I love tackling
            challenges, learning new technologies, and creating impactful
            solutions. Beyond coding, I believe discipline applies
            everywhereâ€”both in tech and life. ðŸ’ª -
